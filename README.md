Thought of here, her face went red.
Remember not long ago, again late at night watching the game.
Who knows China die so timid (temporary but said the game, while there might be a trace of roaming gas) in the group stages, and shortly before the defeat of the team, die to "convince" team, is the national youth team recently won the Asian crown, if our system, also embodies the Chinese player's rough and tactics, the poor, this shows that Chinese football from root rot, from bad the intestines.
How to do?
Scraping the bone healing.
Although after each fans have swear no longer see the experience of Chinese football, but after the division of the war, my mind was completely cool down.
From the bottom of my heart want to shout: "let China's football death more thoroughly!"
Under the economic system in China, only a completely death is likely to live again.

So, Chinese football again die of pathos, again and again, but to live.
This is a kind of the soft power of the invisible or visible in manipulating it, make it a double victims of officialdom and money field.

Is to transform the the whole world, will learn to meet.
The fittest exist, the bigger the game, the stronger the ability to play himself.
Its boast in the day our investors, no progress, insensitive, drift hate evil, be inferior to conscientiously at the moment, the connection exaggerate my understanding of and ability, armed with common sense, connect to explore unique.
Six, says I love you won't regret it, I said you in the side is beautiful.
Seems to be in that moment, I have not see remote you, I fell great deep canyons, only caught a glimpse of a miserable, I sad overworked a bleak, through the withering yellow skirts, port in the journey, I reach for you, die of want to hold your shoulders, you GuLi marginal, but can't see me, see me looked away, so near, but you let me struggling to resist, you gave me a block of solitary line.
